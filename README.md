# Set up Environment
Python 3 is the main language used in this codebase.
We strongly encourage the use of Python [virtual environments](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/):

    virtualenv venv -p /usr/bin/python3
    source venv/bin/activate

After which, simply install all the required python modules via

    pip install -r requirements.txt
(here I'm just putting some of the commonly used modules here, there are lots more out there)
